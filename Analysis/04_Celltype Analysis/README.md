##  Clustree gave us the optimal resolution of *1.5* for further analysis
## The Seurat analysis yielded 23 final clusters, whose quality was evaluated using the silhouette score. In computer science, the silhouette score measures the quality of clustering by assessing how well a data point is matched to its own cluster compared to other clusters.










## ðŸŒŸ We identified 7 major Cell types among 15 Samples:

- 2. Endothelial Cells
- 3. T Cells
- 4. B Cells
- 6. Myeloids
- 7. Dendritic Cells (DCs)
