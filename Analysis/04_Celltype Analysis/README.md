## The Seurat analysis yielded 23 clusters, whose quality was evaluated using the silhouette score.










# Cluster Annotation
### The clusters were annotated using two mouse datasets, SingleR and ImmGen, along with manual annotation based on marker genes. This process led to the identification of 7 final clusters.
### ðŸŒŸCelltypes:



- 1. Epithelial Cells
- 2. Endothelial Cells
- 3. T Cells
- 4. B Cells
- 6. Myeloids
- 7. Dendritic Cells (DCs)
- 8. Others
