## 📊 Overview

This repository presents the results of a comprehensive single-cell RNA sequencing analysis, comparing the effects of an inhibitor treatment on male and female samples. Our study provides insights into RNA count distributions, feature distributions, and cell count variations across different samples and treatments.

## 🔬 Key Findings

### 1. RNA Count Distribution by Treatment and Sex

- 🔹 Inhibitor-treated samples show wider RNA count ranges, especially in males
- 🔹 Male samples generally exhibit higher median RNA counts
- 🔹 Notable variability between treatment groups and sexes

### 2. Feature Distribution Across Barcodes

- 🔹 Feature counts (genes detected) vary significantly across barcodes
- 🔹 Most samples peak between 2000-5000 features
- 🔹 Some barcodes (e.g., BC15) show broader distributions, indicating higher cell-to-cell variability

### 3. Cell Count Analysis by Sample

- 🔹 Substantial variation in cell counts across samples
- 🔹 Inhibitor-treated male samples generally have higher cell counts
- 🔹 Vehicle-treated samples show more consistent cell counts across replicates

### 4. RNA Counts vs Number of Features

- 🔹 Strong positive correlation between RNA counts and features detected
- 🔹 Non-linear relationship with plateau effect at higher RNA counts
- 🔹 Similar trends for both treatment groups, with slight variations at upper distribution

### 5. Feature Distribution by Treatment and Sex

- 🔹 Inhibitor-treated samples show higher median feature counts
- 🔹 Male samples exhibit slightly higher and more variable feature counts
- 🔹 Inhibitor treatment effect more pronounced in male samples

### 6. Density of RNA Counts by Treatment

- 🔹 Distinct distribution patterns for inhibitor-treated vs. vehicle-treated samples
- 🔹 Inhibitor-treated samples show a shift towards higher RNA counts
- 🔹 Vehicle-treated samples have a more peaked distribution at lower RNA counts

## 💡 Key Conclusions

1. Inhibitor treatment significantly impacts both RNA counts and detected features, with a more pronounced effect in male samples.
2. Substantial sample-to-sample variability underscores the importance of biological replicates in single-cell studies.
3. The RNA count-feature relationship suggests a saturation effect, crucial for normalization and downstream analyses.
4. Sex-specific differences in treatment response warrant further investigation into potential mechanisms.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- 🔬 Conduct differential expression analysis to identify treatment-affected genes
- 🧬 Perform pathway enrichment analysis to understand impacted biological processes
- 🔍 Investigate cell-type composition to determine treatment effects on specific populations
- 🛠 Implement additional quality control measures to address sample variability
