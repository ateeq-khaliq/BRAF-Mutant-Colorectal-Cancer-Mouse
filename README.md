## 🎯 Research Objectives

1. Understand how BRAF plus EGFR inhibitor treatment alters tumor composition in BRAFV600E colorectal cancer
2. Identify cell populations that can be therapeutically targeted to improve therapy response

## 🧫 Key Findings

- BRAF mutant colorectal cancer is enriched for enteroendocrine cells (EECs)
- EECs are important in therapy-induced transdifferentiation
- BRAF plus EGFR inhibition promotes EEC differentiation

## 🔬 Methodology

- **Model**: Syngeneic orthotopic model of metastatic BRAFV600E colorectal cancer
- **Treatment**: Encorafenib (BRAFi) + Gefitinib/Cetuximab (EGFRi)
- **Analysis**: FLEX single-cell RNA sequencing

## 📊 Experimental Design

![Sample Distribution](images/Picture1.png)

- Total Samples: 15
  - 8 Vehicle-treated (4 male, 4 female)
  - 7 Inhibitor-treated (4 male, 3 female)

## 🔍 Research Goals

1. Identify cell types present (cancer cells, immune cells, CAFs)
2. Determine changes in cell type proportions with treatment
3. Analyze signaling changes induced by treatment
4. Select samples for spatial transcriptomics

## 🌟 Significance

This research aims to improve treatment outcomes for patients with metastatic BRAF mutant colorectal cancer by understanding therapy-induced cellular changes and identifying new therapeutic targets.
